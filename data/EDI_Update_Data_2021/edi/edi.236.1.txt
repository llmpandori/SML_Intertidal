  Shoals Marine Laboratory, jointly operated by Cornell University and
  the University of New Hampshire, has conducted annual surveys of
  intertidal biota on Appledore Island since 1972 and on Star Island in
  1970-72. The primary goal of the survey is to train undergraduate
  university students in observation, species identification, survey
  methodology, data collection and management, and science
  communication. The secondary, but equally important, goal is to
  generate a long-term record of intertidal biota found on Appledore
  Island, Maine USA. This published dataset includes species presence,
  abundance, size, and distribution since 1985, the earliest year full
  records were available for digital archive.

  Sampling was conducted using 20 x 20 cm square quadrats, from the low
  to high intertidal zone, at 0.33 meter (1.0 foot) intervals in
  vertical height from mean low water at each of several transects
  around the island. A comprehensive protocol is provided in a separate
  file. There have been modifications to the protocol over time, which
  are noted in the provided data quality document. Please review these
  documents in the .zip archive before making use of this dataset.
