1993,15,3,2,yes,Notes,7/21/97 TJF - In several replicates  students noted presence of L. littorea or Littorina sp.; however  the only species that usually occurs in highly exposed areas such as this one is L. saxatilis.  I recorded all littorines as L saxatilis. 2/2008: MME: do NOT agree with assumption---while the majority of snails in the high intertidal on the exposed side of Appledore ARE L. saxatilis  there are certainly some L. littorea to be found as well  and L. saxatilis would almost NEVER be found as low as Level 12  even on the exposed side of the island....could be L. obtusata  since there is Fucus in the lower levels  but there's really no way to know. Just recorded all unidenitified snails as Littorina sp in notes column  put some nds in Littorina data colimns as placeholders...not sure that's a good idea,counts
